# 100DaysOfCode

##### Today's objective

- refactor day_002's code to use and abstract base class and dependency injection approach rather than inheritance
    - maintain the concept of Cats and Dogs being Pets, so maintain a Pet superclass
    - introduce dependency injection to make the instantiation of classes more flexible
