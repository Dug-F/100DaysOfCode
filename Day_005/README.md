# 100DaysOfCode

##### Today's objective

- Refactor day_004's code to replace radio buttons with dropdowns
    - do not add any further classes - this must all be done with dependency injection
    - all types of Dog must be able to fetch and all types of Cat must be able to purr
    - move towards implementing a factory pattern - not yet implemented
